Key takeaways:
1. The structures are stored as cartesian coordiantes.
2. While all bond lengths match based on whether the structures were extracted with ASE (method 1) or pymatgen (method 2), the HOO bond angles were different.
3. Filtering criteria for OOH: (1) OO bond length between 1.3-1.5 A (ideal: ~1.46 A); (2) OH bond length between 0.9-1.1 A (ideal: ~1 A); 
(3) OOH bond angle between 95-115 degrees (ideal: ~104 degrees).
