Filtering Method

We began with 491 candidates containing all OER intermediates (412 unique OOH–slab systems and 408 unique OH–slab systems). The workflow was as follows:

1. Extract all OOH–slab structures and calculate bond lengths and angles.

2. Extract all OH–slab structures and calculate bond lengths.

3. Apply filtering criteria (listed below).

Key takeaways:

1. Structures are stored in Cartesian coordinates.

2. Bond lengths were consistent across extraction methods (ASE vs. pymatgen), but H–O–O bond angles differed.

3. However, the final lists of candidates after filtering were the same.

Filtering criteria:

OH adsorbates:
O–H bond length: 0.9–1.1 Å (ideal ≈ 1.0 Å)

OOH adsorbates:
1. O–O bond length: 1.3–1.5 Å (ideal ≈ 1.46 Å)

2. O–H bond length: 0.9–1.1 Å (ideal ≈ 1.0 Å)

3. H–O–O bond angle: 95–115° (ideal ≈ 104°)

→ If the above criteria were not met, the adsorbate(s) were inferred to have dissociated.

→ For structures with multiple adsorbates, a structure was retained only if all adsorbates satisfied the criteria.
