Duplicate adsorption energies in the OC2022 dataset

Multiple adsorption energies may occur under the following conditions:
(1) Candidates sharing the same bulk_id, miller_index, slab_sid, and nads
(2) Candidates with the same bulk_id, miller_index, and slab_sid, but different nads
(3) Candidates with the same bulk_id and miller_index, but different slab_sid

This code identifies and flags such duplicate adsorption energies.
